# Kareems New Kubernetes

This repository contains Kareems New Kubernetes Deployment configuration.
It's designed to use outputs from and be built on top of the Terraform [Base VPC and Bastion Template](https://github.com/KptnKMan/deploy-vpc-aws).
This is designed to bring up a cluster in AWS (Amazon Web Services) that is empty and ready to manipulate.
This is intended to eventually reflect production-ready implementation.
This implementation is very stable, but it is in testing, and may not work if documentation is not followed.

It contains:

* [x] Documentation for setup and management
* [x] Deployment Kubernetes Cluster
* [x] Default configuration and settings to build environment
* [x] Scripts to create, update and cleanup infrastructure
* [ ] Demo details of things to do with Kubernetes

Additional documentation for setup can be found in [docs](docs), when they become available.

Best to start at the [base vpc template setup doc](https://github.com/KptnKMan/deploy-vpc-aws/blob/master/docs/setup.md) and then [this repos setup doc](docs/setup.md) to setup an environment.

## Basic Requirements

* An AWS Account.
  * No special AWS limits are required.
* An AWS Route53 Hosted zone in your account.
  * A Hosted zone is configured by default in this deployment.
  * This is required for setup of DNS addresses which will make interaction with cluster easier.
  * If you don't have/use a Route53 hosted zone, you should delete the [`dns.tf`](terraform/dns.tf) file, and ignore any references that are not ELB DNS addresses.
* kubectl 1.10.6+
* Terraform 0.11.7
* ~~Ansible 2.4.1.0+~~
* ~~an ssh public/private keypair in /config dir~~
  * the ssh-keypair name is inherited from the output of the parent base vpc template.
  * the ssh-keypair will be auto-generated into the /config dir of the base vpc template.

## Things to do/know to deploy this template

This template should be a ready to go template, but you may want to customise some elements before deploy and at future redeploys/updates. The most common task will likely be scaling the cluster, and changing instance types/sizes.

It is not recommended to change core cluster functionality and references after the cluster template is deployed, this is indicated in notes and template comments.

### Variables

* Security
  * SSH keypair
    * There is no need to generate
    * the base vpc generates this and output is used by this template
  * ROOT_CA/ETCD/API/Admin/Worker TLS certs
    * There is no need to manually generate
    * these are auto-generated by this template, using TLS provisioner
    * available in dir "config/ssl"
    * will be generated at deploy time
* Setup basic cluster variables
  * cluster_name
  * cluster_name_short
  * s3_state_bucket
  * s3_backup_bucket
  * dns_urls
* Setup advanced cluster variables
  * instance_types
  * instances
  * kubernetes
  * cluster_tags
  * efs_storage

## Notes

Versions tested:

* kubectl: 1.10.6 In testing: 1.11.x
* terraform: 0.8.8 upto 0.11.7
* ~~ansible-playbook: 2.2.1.0, 2.4.1.0~~

Terraform Inputs:

* This template will accept and require a number of outputs from the base template.
* You will want to deploy the [base vpc template](https://github.com/KptnKMan/deploy-vpc-aws) first.
